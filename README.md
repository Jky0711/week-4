## Define Routes and View Functions: 
- Use the @app.route() decorator to map URLs to Python functions that will be the view for that route.
## Run the App: 
- Invoke app.run() to start the development server for the application.

# SDLC and Cloud Native Development
# AI Tools in Digital Development

## Impact
- AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT are transforming coding by providing real-time suggestions and automating tasks, leading to faster development and improved code quality.

## Advantages
- These tools streamline the coding process, assist in early error detection, and offer learning support for new languages or frameworks.

## Challenges
- Integration of AI into development requires careful review of AI-generated code to ensure accuracy and avoid over-reliance that may impede skill development.

# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

## Best Practices
- Set up a strong version control system, automate tests for early bug detection, and automate deployments for a smooth transition to production.

## Tools and Strategies
- Use platforms like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions for workflow automation and Docker with Kubernetes for consistent deployment orchestration.

# DevOps Methodologies

## Overview
- DevOps encourages collaboration between development and operations, reducing the software development lifecycle and enabling continuous delivery of high-quality software.

## Techniques
- Employ automated testing, continuous integration, infrastructure as code, along with monitoring and logging to improve efficiency and reliability.

# Cloud-Native Design Patterns

## Principles
- Design for cloud scalability, flexibility, and resilience; adopt microservices, containerization, and serverless computing.

## Importance
- Cloud-native technology adoption is vital for achieving high availability and scalability, promoting rapid innovation and market adaptability.
